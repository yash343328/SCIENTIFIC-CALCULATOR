# Scientific-Calculator
 In this example, I'll guide you through the process of building a basic scientific calculator with some common mathematical operations and functions. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the Tkinter library for the GUI.
Here's a step-by-step guide to building a scientific calculator mini-project in Python:
1-Install Tkinter (if not already installed)
2-Import required librarie
3-Create the GUI
This creates a basic scientific calculator with numbers, basic operators (+, -, *, /), and some advanced functions (sin, cos, tan, sqrt, ^, (, )). The calculator GUI uses the Tkinter library, and the calculations are performed using Python's built-in eval function and the math module for advanced functions.
Please note that the use of eval can be a security risk if your calculator is to be used in an untrusted environment. In this case, it's better to implement your own parsing and calculation functions instead of using eval.
